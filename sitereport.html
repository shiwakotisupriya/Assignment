	<h1>My experience of learning Web development.</h1>
	 <p>
	 	I came into this class with little to no knowledge of HTML and CSS. However, over the course of this term, I learned a lot, and through blood sweat and tears, became efficient using HTML and CSS. As hard and time consuming it was, I genuinely belive that this class is very benificial. I worked hard and learned alot. At, the very first day of the class my mind was totally dull but today, around after nine weeks I can find many knowledges amd skills inside me about HTML and CSS.<br>Not to mention,it is difficult to learn and use HTML and CSS.As th beginner, learning even the basics of code was very challenging, because it was nothing like anything I had done before.Through practice, I slowly grew to have understanding of them, but there is much more that I could learn.From this course, I also learn how difficult working with computer and internet really is.<br>Once you understand coding,it is a kind of fun. This assignment has helped me a lot to understand and chek my progress on HTML and CSS. It has also developed my confidence. Adding images, working with layout and animations is really exiciting. I learned how HTML and CSS works together to create and design website.<br>Unitimately, this course was exteremely beneficial to me. I dont think I ever would have actively sought this course out, but I am very glad that I took it. I learned a lot things I hardly knew existed before,and the stress that I felt is completely justified,knowing that I have learned and grown so much.I can clearly see changes on myself within nine weeks in this feild. I am very glad and exicited to learn further more new topics and codes.

	 <h2>Module learning experience.</h2>
	   <p>
	      While talking about this module, I find more interesting  and fun. Leacture slides has     explained every of the topics very clearly. Module lecturer is also friendly. Due to his polite and friendly behavour it has been much easy to interact with leacturer and clear doubts and confusion. Exercises given in a leacture slides has helped lot to develope skills and learn the uses of different tags.

      <h3>Report on designes used in websites</h3>
      <p>11<sup>th</sup>May,2022</p>
      <p>This is my first experience of learning to develop a website.This website consist of five  html pages,i.e (index, portfolio, contact, blog, sitereport) </p> <br> <p>I have made different css for every pages, because I am not much familier with a single css for multiple pages. Every of the pages are responsive designed, I have used hamburger icon which is visible only in mobile version. Three hamburger tags have been used because while using only one tag I got a little problem.<br>
      In home page, I have used background image and also have referenced that image. Those images, colors, and hoover is used according to my own choice. There is just my name in home page. Next is the portfolio page.In this page, I have used grid layout for column.  Two placeholder images has been insert inside column. Background image has also inserted, placeholder  image and background image has  already referenced above. I have also used text shadow in this page. Now comes contact page. This page includes my contact information. Animation  has been used in this page. Next is blog page. In this page, I have explained in brif about before starting assignment, during doing assignment and near to the submission phase. Here, I have used grid for columns and also used text shadow and transformation. And this is the site report. This page describes in brief about my experience, module and about my website.
      <br><br>
      Hence, I have practiced a lot and finally I am able to create a website. This assignment is really very benificial. I can test my self progress.
