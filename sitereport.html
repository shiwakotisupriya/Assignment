	<h1>My experience of learning web design.</h1>
	<p>I came into this class with little to no knowledge of HTML and CSS. However, over the course of this term, I learned a lot, and through blood sweat and tears, became efficient using HTML and CSS. As hard and time consuming it was, I genuinely belive that this class is very benificial. I worked hard and learned alot. At, the very first day of the class my mind was totally dull but today, around after nine weeks I can find many knowledges amd skills inside me about HTML and CSS.<br>Not to mention,it is difficult to learn and use HTML and CSS.As th beginner, learning even the basics of code was very challenging, because it was nothing like anything I had done before.Through practice, I slowly grew to have understanding of them, but there is much more that I could learn.From this course, I also learn how difficult working with computer and internet really is.<br>Once you understand coding,it is a kind of fun. This assignment has helped me a lot to understand and chek my progress on HTML and CSS. It has also developed my confidence. Adding images, working with layout and animations is really exiciting. I learned how HTML and CSS works together to create and design website.<br>Unitimately, this course was exteremely beneficial to me. I dont think I ever would have actively sought this course out, but I am very glad that I took it. I learned a lot things I hardly knew existed before,and the stress that I felt is completely justified,knowing that I have learned and grown so much.I can clearly see changes on myself within nine weeks in this feild. I am very glad and exicited to learn further more new topics and codes.</p>
